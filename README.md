# CarouselSlider and Text To Speech

This app is simply to show how [Text To Speech](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts) and [CarouselSlider](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider) works. We'll build a slider with different colors. When a color is highlighted we'll make use of TTS to say the name of the color.
